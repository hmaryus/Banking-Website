**I've tried to create something as my first Django project and I decided that a small banking site would be great. This includes:**

* User Registration
* User data customization
* Password Recovery tool
* Deposit/Withdraw functions
* Transactions History
* Daily currency exchange rates
* Account balance graph.

For the future, it can be expanded with _Transfer money to another account, Pay utility bills, Mobile authentificator._
